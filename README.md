This is a script for screen scraping data form OCLC's WorldCat.org or FirstSearch database. It's primary purpose is to quickly get bibliographic data into a spreadsheet ot help with processing library material requests and orders. It works for materials in any language with a special emphasis on Japanese in particular. The script is written in [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (AHK) and is designed to work in tandem with custom designed spreadsheets.

   - This script has only been tested in Windows 10. It should work with previous versions as far back as Windows 8.
