# CJK Material Processing
This is a macro script for screen scraping data form OCLC's WorldCat.org or FirstSearch database. It's primary purpose is to quickly get bibliographic data into a spreadsheet ot help with processing library material requests and orders. It works for materials in any language with a special emphasis on Japanese in particular. The macro is written in [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (AHK) and is designed to work in tandem with custom designed spreadsheets.

## ðŸ”° Basic Requirements for Use
1. PC with Windows OS.
   - This macro has only been tested in Windows 10. It should work with previous versions as far back as Windows 8.
2. The AHK executible file: *BibData to Spreadsheet.exe*
   - Download it at the top of this page.
3. One of two compatiable Spreadsheets:
   - [Donation Intake Template](https://github.com/ahlisbon/CJKmaterialProcessing/blob/master/Collection%20Development%20-%20Donation%20-%20Template.xlsm)
   - [Ordering Materials Template](https://github.com/ahlisbon/CJKmaterialProcessing/blob/master/Collection%20Development%20-%20Orders%20-%20Template.xlsm)

This macro has been tested extensively in FireFox while using the spreadsheet as an Excel File. It has successfully worked in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, though has not undergone extensive testing in those browsers. Additionally, The Excel File may be used as a spreadsheet in Office 365 or Google Drive. Again, testing has been very limited in these alternative environments, but successful.

## âš  Must Knows
- The "kill switch" for the macro is the backslash "\\" (above the "enter" key on most keyboards). Unusual behavior is always possible and this hotkey will stop the macro.
- Slower internet connections may cause the macro to malfunction and stop.

## ðŸ”¥ Hotkeys to Activate Macro
Several keyboard keys are repurposed to start and stop the macro, referred to as "Hotkeys." F1 through F12 and the numpad keys are repuprosed for quick and easy use of the macro. It is *highly* recommended that you use a keyboard with a numpad as it is much each easier to use. In case you do not have a keyboard with a numpad, the function keys will suffice.

- Pause / F12
  - Deativates hotkeys so you can use your keyboard like normal. Press again to reactivate hotkey functionality.
- Numpad 1 / F1
  - Starts the macro.
- Numpad 4 / F4
  - On a loaded WorldCat.org / FirstSearch record, pulls the Subject Heading data into the spreadsheet.
- Numpad 5 / F5
  - On a loaded WorldCat.org / FirstSearch record, pulls the OCLC# into the spreadsheet.
- Numpad 6 / F6
  - On a loaded WorldCat.org / FirstSearch record, pulls "all" data into the spreadsheet that is available, including:
    - ISBN 10
    - ISBN 13
    - OCLC#
    - Title (Romanized)
    - Title (Non-Romanized)
    - Author/Creator (Romanized)
    - Author/Creator (Non-Romanized)
    - Series Title (Romanized)
    - Series Title (Non-Romanized)
    - Publisher (Romanized)
    - Publisher (Non-Romanized)
    - Date of Publication (Romanized)
    - Subject Headings

## ðŸ“Š How the Spreadsheets Work
There are two spreadsheet templates to choose from:
- [Collection Development - Donations - Template.xslx](https://github.com/ahlisbon/CJKmaterialProcessing/blob/master/Collection%20Development%20-%20Donation%20-%20Template.xlsm)
- [Collection Development - Orders - Template.xslx](https://github.com/ahlisbon/CJKmaterialProcessing/blob/master/Collection%20Development%20-%20Orders%20-%20Template.xlsm)

These spreadsheets work in tandem with the macro to bring data from WC/FS. The most important element is that *the order of the columns CANNOT be changed*. However, there is a great deal that can be altered. Each spreadsheet has a "Guide" sheet that explains how the spreadsheet works.

Further, both spreadsheets use a great deal of data validation and conditional formatting. Much of these formatting choices were done to give real time feedback on common errors and to improve readability. However, these can be removed entirely. There are also many additional sheets, beginning with "s-", for doing data analysis on your donations/orders as well. These can also be ignored/removed/deleted.

## â„¹ How the Macro Works
The macro works in tandem with the speadsheet ([see more above](https://github.com/ahlisbon/CJKmaterialProcessing/blob/master/README.md#how-the-spreadsheet-works)) to present bibliographic data in a way that makes tracking library materials, either as orders or donations, or any other number of use cases, easier to manage.

### Basic Walkthrough
_Double click_ the .exe file to start the program.
- An interface will appear, provide the following information:
  - The title of your spreadsheet and the name of your Library as it appears in WorldCat.org.
  - The URL your institution uses to access FirstSearch
  - The title of your Library as it appears in WorldCat.org.
- _Click_ "Update Settings." These will all be saved for the next time you use the macro.

Open the spreadsheet, there will be several rows of samples to try with the macro. You can delete these if you don't want to try some practice runs. Alternatively, you would enter an OCLC#, ISBN10, ISBN13, or title in the appropriate column and then run the macro to find a record in WorldCat.org or FirstSearch (WC/FS from now on) and bring all of the associated metadata into the spreadsheet. We will follow a simple example:

1. A donation has arrived. Using a scan gun, the barcode on a book is scanned to populate the ISBN-13 column.
2. Make sure a browser window is open.
   - If using FS, make sure to initially login.
4. With any cell in the same row as the ISBN13 highlighted, _press numpad1/F1_ to run the macro.
   - In WC, the macro will activate your broswer window, then open a new window to actually search WC.
   - In FS, the search will happen in the same window.
   - Expect to see some flashing blue as the macro highlights text to determine what to do next.
   - One Result vs. Multiple Results:
      - If there is 1 result in FS/WC, that record will load instantly.
      - If there are multiple results, the macro will stop at this list.
        - You should click on the record that appears to be of the highest quality/accuracy.
5. Assess the quality of the record for if you want to import the data.
   - If you feel the recrd is low quality, you can press _numpad7/F7_ to see what other records are available.
     - A list of records will load and then each record will attempt to be loaded individually in a new tab.
     - You can quickly browse through these tabs by pressing _numpad0_.
     - You can remove the tabs of records you have ruled out be pressing _numpad-_ (numapd minus sign).
